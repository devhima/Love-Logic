# Love-Logic
Written By. Ibrahim Said Elsharawy (dev-hima.blogspot.com)

Love-Logic is a humorous Java code
 describes impossible love story condition which appears in an infinite loop of overthinking and waiting for both sides.
 
When you run this code, it creates an infinite loop where:
Both "him" and "her" keep thinking the same thing
.
Neither ever texts because of an impossible condition.
They both keep checking their silent phones.
The program never ends (just like their waiting).


The output would look something like:
```
---
**NOTE**
Him: If she loves me, she'll text me first...
Her: If he loves me, he'll text me first...
Both phones remain silent...
Current status: Still single and overthinking
Him: If she loves me, she'll text me first...
Her: If he loves me, he'll text me first...
Both phones remain silent...
Current status: Still single and overthinking..

The code humorously captures the stalemate where both parties have the same logic, resulting in no action ever being taken - a perfect programmer's take on the situation! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤š
